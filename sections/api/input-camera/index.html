    <h3>Allow photo album AND the camera</h3>
    <p>
      On Android devices, if you want to create a file input that prompts the user to either choose an image from their
      photo album or take a picture with their camera, you'll need this basically undocumented capture attribute added
      to your input's accept property:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; accept=&quot;image/*;capture=camera&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      On iOS, the operating system will always show an image picker and the camera with a type="file" input even if it
      doesn't have the ;capture=camera directive.
      Also note, this attribute only does anything on mobile operating systems, this won't change the behavior of your
      inputs for desktop clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="file" accept="image/*;capture=camera"/>
    </p>

    <h3>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/capture" target="_blank">capture</a> property</h3>
    <p>
      A final note: if you add a capture property to a file input, like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot; accept=&quot;image/*&quot; capture=&quot;environment&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      ...this tells the browser to prefer camera capture over an image picker. The values can be "environment" or "user".
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment" />
